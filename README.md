# Frontend Development Test

*This test was part of Domain Group's frontend coding test*

## Task: hCard Builder



[hCard is a simple, open format for publishing people, companies and
organizations on the web](http://microformats.org/wiki/hCard).

Our ever-vigilant design/UX team has put together a layout for an app, *hCard
Builder*. This app is something we would like to use in the future when allowing
users to edit their personal details on our site.

Based on the design provided (in `design.psd`), build the *hCard Builder* app in
HTML/CSS/JS, as if it was going to be shipped live at the end of the next sprint
once fully verified working by the testing team.

(**Note:** If you don't have Photoshop available, you can see examples of the
empty & completed states in the two provided `.png` files)

Allow approximately 4-5 hours to complete the task.

### Requirements

* As the form is filled out, the preview should be automatically updated
* The submit button does not need to function (ie; no backend is required for
  this task)
* When the user selects an image, a thumbnail should be shown in the preview
  (no backend is required for this task)
* The app should be responsive for different screen widths

## Results

### How to run

* To run this file, download and 'cd' into domain_vue and run 'yarn serve'.
* To run the ReactJS verion, download and 'cd' into domain_react and run 'npm start'.

### Steps in building this

* Create static elements using HTML/CSS/JS & Bootstrap library.
* Determine what parent and child components are necessary.
* Create CSS flexbox/grids and apply colours/ font-family
* Add Javascript snippet for image upload preview.
* Depending on the version, implement logic in React and Vue to bind data to the input form, allowing for live previews.


### Challenges

* If I had a bit more time, I would refactor more of the code (add more components) and implement hCard's classes in Vue as well.


### Live app

* The live VueJS version of the app is deployed here on Heroku: http://domain420.herokuapp.com/
